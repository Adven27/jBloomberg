/**
 * A high level API to submit requests to the Bloomberg API or subscribe to real time data updates. <br>
 * The typical life cycle of a BloombergSession is:
 * <ul>
 * <li> start the session
 * <li> get data from Bloomberg:
 * <ul>
 * <li> submit requests, which are used to query static or historical data
 * <li> subscribe to real time updates, typically to track the real time price of a security
 * </ul>
 * <li> stop the session: this releases all the internal resources used, including thread pools. Not stopping a session
 * could prevent the JVM from exiting.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that long running requests might delay real time subscriptions. It is recommended to use at least one session
 * for
 * real time subscriptions and one for static or historical requests.
