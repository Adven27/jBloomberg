jBloomberg
==========

jBloomberg is a high-level API that wraps the low level Bloomberg API.
Although most features of the underlying Bloomberg API are available, some options might not be reachable through the jBloomberg API.

See the package javadoc for more information (https://github.com/assylias/jbloomberg/blob/master/src/main/java/assylias/jbloomberg/package-info.java).

You need to manually download the Bloomberg API at http://www.openbloomberg.com/open-api/.
